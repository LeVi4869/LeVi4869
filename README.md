Hello, I'm Vinh, currently a Junior studying for my Bachelor's degree in CS at the University of Massachussetts, Amherst.

My interests lie in game making, machine learning, and simply just algorithms/competitive programming.

Currently just learning new stuff and looking for SWE internships.

For some of my projects, please check out my repositories.
