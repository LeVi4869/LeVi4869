Hello, I'm Vinh, currently a sophomore studying for my Bachelor's degree in the University of Massachussetts, Amherst.

My interests lie in game making, machine learning, and simply just algorithms/competitive programming.

I am open to any internship opportunities, please message me through my GitHub or LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinh-le-a17908205/) if you are looking for someone to fill an intern role. I prefer Software Engineering roles the most.

For some of my projects, please check out my repositories.
