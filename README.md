Hello, I'm Vinh, currently a Masters student studying CS at the University of Massachussetts Amherst.

My interests lie in game making, machine learning, and simply just algorithms/competitive programming.

Currently just learning new stuff and looking for SWE full time roles. I am graduating in December 2024 with my Masters degree

For some of my projects, please check out my repositories.
